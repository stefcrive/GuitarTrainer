# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
This project is a rules template system designed to enhance AI-assisted coding by providing structured guidelines and documentation patterns. It focuses on creating a standardized approach to software development while maintaining effective context across different AI coding assistants.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Must work seamlessly with multiple AI coding assistants (Cursor, CLINE, RooCode, Windsurf)
- Must maintain consistent context across different platforms
- Must support symbolic linking for rule files to ensure single source of truth

### 2. Documentation System
- Implement comprehensive memory file structure
- Support automatic documentation updates
- Maintain clear separation between core and context files

### 3. Directory Structure
- Enforce modular project organization
- Support standard software development directories (src, test, config, etc.)
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

### 4. Rule Management
- Provide clear workflows for planning, implementation, and debugging
- Support token optimization through custom modes
- Enable flexible rule adaptation while maintaining core principles

## Features

### Memory Management
- Persistent project documentation
- Hierarchical knowledge base structure
- Auto-updating context system

### Custom Modes
1. Chat Mode - Traditional LLM interaction
2. Write Mode - File operations and command execution
3. MCP Mode - Model Context Protocol server integration

### Documentation Generation
- Automated documentation updates
- Support for RFC creation
- Integration with existing documentation workflows

## Success Metrics
- Reduced context switching overhead
- Improved documentation consistency
- Enhanced development workflow efficiency
- Optimized token usage across platforms

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Unified ignore file system
- [ ] Test-Driven Development integration
- [ ] Boomerang Task Mode implementation
- [ ] Context handoff optimization

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with latest versions of AI coding assistants
- Must support Windows, Linux, and macOS environments
- Must handle symbolic links appropriately
